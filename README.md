Are you planning to save? Put your money on deposit? Would you like to know what profit it will bring to you? You have a simple and clear calculator app in front of you which will help you with it.
- Incredible clear interface. You don't need to finish a special course to be able to use it.
- Size less than 10 MB. Despite its small weight will help you to save money.
- Offline work. You don't need an Internet access.
- Support for split-screen. You can have a banking app opened on one side and use this app on the other.

Remember that the result may slightly differ from the real value, because it doesn't count inflation and other factors :)
